JavaScript Line Drawer
=========================

This is a javascript library used to draw lines on the screen easily and efficiently. 
The method is taken from a demo found on http://www.p01.org/releases/Drawing_lines_in_JavaScript/ (I believe it was written by Mathieu 'P01' HENRI)
I turned it into a Prototype class, with some useful functions. This project includes a simple demo in index.html.

There is a demo at http://lines.live2code.ca
or you can check out the code at http://github.com/forrest/javascript-line-class


Line class:
  initialize(x1,y1,x2,y2)
  
    line1 = new Line(x1,y1,x2,y2);
  
  update(Ax,Ay,Bx,By)
  
    line1.update((x1,y1,x2,y2))
  
  destroy()
  
    line1.destroy()
  
  start()
  
    returns [x1,y1]
  
  stop()
  
    returns [x2,y2]
